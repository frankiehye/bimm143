# Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
db
```

> Q1. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}

xray.tot <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$X.ray)))
xray.tot

em.tot <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$EM)))
em.tot
```
We found the sum of each column. Let's create a working snippet and a new function

```{r}
#I will work with `x` as the input

sum_comma <- function(x) {
  # Substitue the comma and convert to numeric
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))

}
```

For X ray: 
We'll round the answer to two decimal places
```{r}
round (sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```
86% of structures are solved by X-ray

For EM:
we'll round the answer to 2 decimal places as well. 
```{r}
round( sum_comma(db$EM)/ sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```
7% of structures are solved by EM.

> Q2. What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round (sum_comma(db$Total[1]) / sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```
87% of structures in the PDB file are protein. 

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

> Q3. insert this image

> Q4. Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?


The resolution is too low on the struture to see H atoms. We need a resolution of below 1 Angstroms to visualize the H atoms.

> Q5. There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

# Working with Structures in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
> Q7. How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198 residues

> Q8. Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH127

> Q9. How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 protein chains, (A,B)

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

REad an ADK structure
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```


Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA
```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie" (aka a trajectory) of the motion for viewing in Molstar
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
